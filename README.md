# admin-dashboard

This is an intermediate level HTML & CSS project that was tasked by TOP.
It demonstrates my CSS ability, specifically my use of grid structures. 

It wasn't easy to say the least. I found myself struggling with the grid structures as I had never used them before. I eventually fixed the problems that were gatekeeping me from progress, and I believe, as a result, I am more understanding of grid, and see its benefits. I do, however, prefer flexbox.
